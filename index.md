# About us

> :construction: Heads up! Have a look at the [official Springload careers page](https://www.springload.co.nz/jobs/) to learn more about us.

What’s it like here?

We offer unique, best-practice, tailor-made solutions for our clients. You’ll have an opportunity to work on some of New Zealand’s best known brands, across a wide variety of projects - from mobile to kiosk to desktop. There's plenty of room to grow. We provide the environment for balanced work and play, and we value all our staff here – you are our greatest asset.

We have an incredibly skilled and close-knit team, across all disciplines. We're offering the right person the perfect job - great people, great work and great fun. You’ll be treated like a member of the Springload family rather than an employee.

Every year, we provide a learning allowance to spend on conference tickets, workshops, and the likes.

Springload promotes a workplace that celebrates diversity, creativity and talent. We made a formal commitment to ensuring fairness in our workplace when we joined the Equal Employment Opportunities Trust.
