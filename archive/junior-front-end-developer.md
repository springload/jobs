We’re looking for a professional, dedicated and pragmatic front-end developer for a junior position. The successful candidate will be:

- Ambitious, eager to learn, and keen to get their foot on the first rung of the career ladder.
- Responsible and friendly.
- Naturally interested in technology.

While we value formal qualifications they are far from essential. We value proven experience, demonstrable clear, analytical thinking and great communication skills.

As part of this role, you will:

- Create, develop, maintain and improve user interfaces for browser-based products and services. Collaborate with other disciplines and individuals to produce high quality experiences with front-end code (HTML, CSS, SVG and JavaScript).
- Contribute to Springload's front-end capabilities by researching new ideas, maintaining our projects, improving our practices, and demonstrating our expertise.

## Requirements

> Have a look at our [front-end starter kit](https://github.com/springload/frontend-starter-kit/) to learn more about the tools and technologies we use and love.

You will have:

- Ability to communicate front-end development matters clearly to other team members, clients, and partners.
- Understanding of browser, platform, device constraints.
- Basic HTML and CSS knowledge.
- Experience with CSS preprocessing and HTML templating.
- Experience with programming in JavaScript.
- Basic understanding of object-oriented and functional programming concepts.
- Experience with browser development tools (such as Chrome or Firefox DevTools).

Bonus points for:

- Experience with client-side frameworks in CSS and JS.
- Experience with content management systems or e-commerce platforms.
- Familiarity with version control via Git, issue trackers, wikis, and pull request workflows.
- Familiarity with front-end build tools and task runners.
- Familiarity with software testing – unit tests, integration tests.
- Working knowledge of the command line.
- Working knowledge of design tools.

## Benefits

We offer unique, best-practice, tailor-made solutions for our clients. You’ll have an opportunity to work on some of New Zealand’s best known brands, across a wide variety of projects - from mobile to kiosk to desktop. There's plenty of room to grow. We provide the environment for balanced work and play, and we value all our staff here—you are our greatest asset.

We have an incredibly skilled and close-knit team, across all disciplines. We're offering the right person the perfect job - great people, great work and great fun. You’ll be treated like a member of the Springload family rather than an employee.

Every year, we provide a learning allowance to spend on conference tickets, workshops, and the likes.

Springload promotes a workplace that celebrates diversity, creativity and talent. We made a formal commitment to ensuring fairness in our workplace when we joined the Equal Employment Opportunities Trust.

We are also an Accredited Employer with New Zealand Immigration. If you don't have New Zealand residency we can help you with your work visa.
